					<h3>Tablle & Bottle Animation Project</h3>
					<div class = "demoVid">
						<div class = "demoText">
							<p>
								This was a project for my Blender class. We were just learning animations and our assignment was to create an animation of a bottle falling off a table.<br>
								I decided to give a reason for the bottle falling, with a baseball breaking a window, knocking it into a TV, and shattering.<br><br>
								This was a project where I got a random, crazy idea that had more work than needed, but I went with it anyway to try to create something enjoyable and funny.

								This was for my final project for my Blender class. <br>
								We were split into groups and were able to create any animated scene we desired.<br>
								My group and I thought it would be funny to recreate bowling from Nintendo's Wii Sports when you fail to launch the ball correctly.<br><br>
								I was in charge of the project. I created the Mii models, the animations, the bowling lane gutters, as well as piecing everyone's contributions together.<br>
								One group member, my friend Eric, created the scoreboards and walls in the scene.<br>
								Another group member, Daniela, created the bowling ball and pins.<br>
								The last group memnber, Shane, created the floor for the bowling alley.
