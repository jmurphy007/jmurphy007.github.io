					<div class = "demoText">
						<h4>Sony &alpha;6400<h4>
						<p>
							This is my main camera, more for when I plan to take photos. <br>
							I use the base kit 18mm - 135mm lens as well as a Tamron 70mm - 300mm lens for my various shots.
						</p>

						<h4>iPhones<h4>
						<p>
							When I do not have easy access to my Sony, I usually rely on my phone camera to try to get a shot.<br>
							When I really started photography, I had an iPhone XS Max. Now, I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max.<br><br>
							Somehow, some of my best shots have come from these phones.

			<h3>Software</h3>

						<h4>Lightroom Classic<h4>
						<p>
							This is my main editing software.
							I have become comfortable with the workflow in this software, so it is the easiest for me.

						<h4>Photoshop<h4>
						<p>
							I have not used Photoshop as much, but I can use this software for any tweaks that cannot be done in Lightroom.
