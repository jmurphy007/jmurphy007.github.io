				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>
					I have always loved video games growing up. Playing games like Pok&eacute;mon, Super Mario, Minecraft, Portal,
					and many more gave me a way to de-stress and express myself.
					As time went on, my curiousity on how these games worked eventaully led me to choose to study computer science.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I had mentioned before, I have been a student at Monclair State University since Fall 2018.
					I am studying to get a BS in Computer Science and am expected to graduate May 2023.
					On the side, I am participating in a game development certificate program at MSU, 
					in which I have learned Blender (game asset modeling & animation), Unreal, and Unity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks to my time dorming on campus, I grew to love the views there and developed a skill in photography.
					I took pictures of whatever interested me; being sunsets, silhouettes, plants, animals, and more.
					I had made a seperate Instagram to share my photos and since January 2022, I have had a decent following.
					With recommendation from a friend of mine, I have even done a photo gig on campus for an event.
				</p>
				<p>
					During my latest years at MSU, I have participated in the gaming club on campus - Montclair University Gamers (M.U.G.).
					In the club, we create a safe, comfortable space for those who like any type of game (video, tabletop, roleplay, etc.)
					can meet like-minded people and enjoy the company of others.
					In this last year as a student here, I was elected to be the club's secretary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks to the help of some friends and my game development professor, we were able to establish a game devopment club on campus for the 2022-2023 year.
					I took the role of vice-president. In the club, we will hold workshops for students to learn about different aspects of the game development scene, and not just the coding ones but all aspects.
					At the end of the semester, we plan to have one final game jam for students to present a project at.
