								Final group project for my Unity Class, a full game using what we learned. The main concept was my idea.
							</p>
							<p>
								Story:<br>
								In the future, there is too much space debris in our atmosphere that it prevents space travel.<br> 
								NASA has to send a robot up to the moon to clear the debris.<br>
								It will use a gizmo in its legs/feet to hop from cloud to cloud into the sky.

							<p>Instructions:</p>
							<ol type = "1">
								<li>Use WASD to navigate through the scene.</li>
								<li>Use the spacebar to jump into the sky.</li>
								<li>White clouds are safe to land on.</li>
								<li>Storm clouds are dangerous, landing on them will mean taking damage.</li>
								<li>After a certain height, there will be some clouds that you can fall through.</li>
								<li>To return the menu, hit Escape or run out of health.</li>
								<li>Try to get as high in the sky as possible!</li>

								For a homework assignment for my Unity class, we had the task to design and develop a 3D campus scene using what we had recently learned.<br>
								The requirements for the assignment are as follows:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Design and create a 3D campus environment. The elements for the campus include buildings, trees, landscape, grasses, playground, etc.</li>
								<li>Create dynamic water (lake/pond/river) by yourself, a screenshot of all wired nodes in the water shader is needed </li>
								<li>Add directional light</li>
								<li>Add point light</li>
								<li>Add spotlight</li>
								<li>Add two or more area lights</li>
								<li>Add the first-person character from the Standard Assets and modify the C# code to make the first-person game runnable</li>
								<li>Use two cameras: one for the player (this one is already included in the first-person character) and another one showing the map location of the player in real time)</li>
								<li>Add water sound to the dynamic water object. Play the sound every time the player approaches the water</li>
								<li>Add background music to your game</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								For this project, since a specific campus was not assigned, I decided to make my own rendition of the school campus in the 2008 Nintendo DS game Pok√©mon Ranger: Shadows of Almia.<br>
								I included the main school building, the training hall, obstacles in the field students train on, and the monument Pledge Stone by the docks.

					<h3>Halloween Village</h3>
					<div class = "demoVid">
						<div class = "demoText">
							<p>
								For a homework assignment for my Unity class, we had the task to create a halloween themed scene using the certain tools we learned recently.<br>
								The requirements for the assignment are as follows:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Your project must have the Halloween ambiance</li>
								<li>You can create a Terrain with a size (width*Length) of 600*600 by Heightmap Sculpting or Sculpting tools</li>
								<li>You can use the Raise or Lower Terrain tool</li>
								<li>You can use the Smooth Height tool</li>
								<li>You can use the Paint Texture tools to create at least two different terrain layers with proper textures, normal maps, and tiling settings</li>
								<li>You can create at least two trees and paint them on the terrain.</li>
								<li>You can paint grasses on the terrain.</li>
								<li>You can create a simple lake with colors.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								At the same time of the assignment, a new season of a show I like called The Owl House came out, and I got an idea for the assignment.<br>
								<br>
								I made a cul-de-sac with a bunch of houses along the road. I made the scene nighttime and added streetlights, pumpkins, and jack-0-lanterns for the Halloween ambiance.<br>
								I surrounded the cul-de-sac in trees and had a lake scene based on a scene from The Owl House hidden in the forest along a dirt path.<br>

								This was finished project I made for my final group project in my Unreal Engine class.<br>
								We were split into groups and could create whatever project we wanted for the assignment.<br>
								My group and I decided we wanted to try to create a parody of the game The Stanley Parable, as it had be recently rereleased with extra content.<br>
							</p>
							<p>
								I created most of the models in the project, including the computer monitor, mouse, keyboard, desk, chair, and doors.<br>
								I also assisted in finding textures for other assets, consulting on the map layout and script lines.<br>
								Another group member, my friend Katie, she lead the project by making the map layout and script as well as piecing together the project on her computer.<br>
								Another group member, Chris, created a filing cabinet and a trash can model to use in the scene.<br>
								The last group member, Victor, only checked to see if our textures could be used on materials in a seperate Unreal Engine project.<br>
								I managed to get my friend Adam to voice the lines in the script since he did a funny impression of the Narrator from the original game.<br>
